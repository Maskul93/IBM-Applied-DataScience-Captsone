This repository contains all the material I developed for achieving the <a href="https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ibm-data-science">IBM Data Science Professional Certificate</a>.

The <code>Jupyter Notebooks</code> here provided represents a part of my *portfolio* regarding the Data Science Field.

The idea of the project is to fully deploy the skills I
acquired and that now I should master for taking part
in a Data Science project based on real data.
The most important aspects would be:

### **Hard skills**

- **Coding** using <code>Python</code> in a <code>Jupyter Notebook</code> environment, using the many Data Science libraries, such as <code>pandas</code>, <code>numpy</code>, <code>scikit-learn</code>, <code>seaborn</code>, <code>folium</code>, <code>plotly</code>, <code>dash</code>, and many more.

- **Computational thinking**, i.e., solving real world
data issues by means of coding instructions.

### **Soft skills**
- **Understanding** the patterns in the data I gathered.
- **Presenting** the data in a way that stakeholders
can be advised.

## The Data Science Project, in brief

**SpaceY** is a newly established rocket launch company which wants to compete against the already established <a href="https://www.spacex.com/">SpaceX</a>.
To do so, SpaceY should be able to:
- Reuse the 1<sup>st</sup> stage rocket booster.
- Be more cost competitive than its competitor.

SpaceX states that their launch services with 1 st stage recovery cost 62 million USD , whereas 15 million USD are required to build a 1 st stage
Falcon 9 booster when excluding R&D and profit margin.

Considering the parameters in our predictive models, a **Decision Tree** was capable to predict the successfulness of 1 st stage booster landing with an accuracy of 89%.

It comes that SpaceY will be able to predict the cost of a launch exploiting the Decision Tree model as a proxy. Thus, SpaceY will be capable of making more informed bids against SpaceX for a rocket launch.
